Git Branching Strategy:

Initialize a new Git repository in the project directory: git init
Create a main branch: git checkout -b main
When starting a new feature, create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
When the feature is complete, merge it back into main: git checkout main followed by git merge feature/my-new-feature
