# Project-goldmine
Creating a learning platform where all nuggets can shine

# Project Setup and Best Practices

## Initial Setup
1. Install essential tools: VSCode, Git, Node.js, npm
2. Set up GitHub repository

## Project Structure
- Create directories: `server/`, `client/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `docs/`

## Git and Version Control
- Use feature branching strategy
- Set up Husky for Git hooks
- Create `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` files with appropriate scripts

## Code Quality and Consistency
- Install and configure ESLint and Prettier
- Set up linting and formatting scripts in `package.json`

## Package Management
- Use npm for dependency management
- Keep dependencies updated with `npm update`

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI/CD pipeline
- not configured at this stage

## Development Environment
- Use Docker for consistent development environments
- Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root
- not configured at this stage

## VSCode Extensions
Install the following extensions:
- ESLint
- Prettier
- GitLens
- Live Server
- Debugger for Chrome
- SQL Server (mssql)

## Testing
- Set up Jest for unit and integration testing
- Create `tests/` directory for test files
- Add test scripts to `package.json`

## Documentation
- Maintain this README with setup instructions and important information
- Document code and APIs as the project grows

Remember to adjust these practices as needed for your specific project requirements.
